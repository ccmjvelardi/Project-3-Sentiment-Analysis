# Project-3-Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis of Pizza Places in Hunterdon County, NJ

Purpose of this assignment:

The main question I have for this data is to try and find a good pizza place in Hunterdon County, NJ. In my experience, it hasn't been the easiest to find a good pizza spot, so I want to do sentiment analysis to see if I can get some ideas.
Another goal of this assignment is to also see if the review ratings are in alignment with the sentiment analysis.

This assignment uses data from Yelps Fusion API for 60 reviews from 20 pizzerias to get sentiment analysis and the 20 most frequently used words from reviews.
